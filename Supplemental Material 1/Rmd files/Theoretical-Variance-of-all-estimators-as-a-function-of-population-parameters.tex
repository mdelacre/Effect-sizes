\section{The variance}\label{the-variance}}

Note: While we focus on the theoretical variance of biased estimators (Cohen's \(d_s\), Glass's \(d_s\), Shieh's \(d_s\) and Cohen's \(d'_s\)) when the normality assumption is met, it is interesting to notice that our main conclusions seem to generalize to biased estimators when samples are extracted from symmetric distributions. Moreover, unbiased estimators depend on the same factors as biased estimators, so our conclusions remain similar for unbiased estimators when samples are extracted from heavy-tailed symmetric distributions.

When the population effect size is zero, the variance of Cohen's \(d_s\) can be simplified as follows:

\[Var_{Cohen's \; d_s} = \frac{N(N-2)}{n_1n_2(N-4)}\]

The \textbf{variance} of Cohen's \(d_s\) is a function of total sample size (N) and the sample size allocation ratio (\(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\)):

  The larger the total sample size, the lower the variance. The variance tends to zero when the total sample size tends to infinity (see Figure \ref{fig:varcohendNsize2});

\end{figure}

While the variance of Cohen's \(d_s\) still depends on the total sample size and the sample sizes allocation ratio, it also depends on the population effect size (\(\delta_{Cohen}\)). The larger the population effect size, the larger the variance. Note that the effect of the population effect size decreases when sample sizes increase, as:\\
\[\lim_{n_1\rightarrow \infty}\left[\frac{df}{df-2} - \left( \frac{\sqrt{\frac{df}{2}} \times \Gamma \left(\frac{df-1}{2} \right)}{\Gamma \left( \frac{df}{2}\right)}\right)^2 \right]=0\]\\
\[\lim_{n_2\rightarrow \infty}\left[\frac{df}{df-2} - \left( \frac{\sqrt{\frac{df}{2}} \times \Gamma \left(\frac{df-1}{2} \right)}{\Gamma \left( \frac{df}{2}\right)}\right)^2 \right]=0\]\\
\[\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty}\left[\frac{df}{df-2} - \left( \frac{\sqrt{\frac{df}{2}} \times \Gamma \left(\frac{df-1}{2} \right)}{\Gamma \left( \frac{df}{2}\right)}\right)^2 \right]=0\]

All these limits are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ESmoderatorcohenNsize2}.

\subsubsection{In summary}\label{in-summary}}

The variance of Cohen's \(d_s\) is a function of the population effect size \(\delta_{Cohen}\), the total sample size (N) and the sample sizes ratio (\(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\)):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variance decreases when the total sample size increases;\\
\item
  The variance also decreases when the sample sizes ratio get closer to 1;\\
\item
  Finally, the variance increases when \(\delta_{Cohen}\) increases. Note that the effect of \(\delta_{Cohen}\) is moderated by the total sample size (the larger \(N\), the smaller the effect of \(\delta_{Cohen}\) on the variance).

\hypertarget{when-delta_glass0}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{When \(\delta_{Glass}=0\)}{When \textbackslash delta\_\{Glass\}=0}}\label{when-delta_glass0}}

When the population effect size is zero, the variance of Glass's \(d_s\) can be simplified as follows:

\[Var_{Glass's \; d_s} = \frac{n_c-1}{n_c-3} \left( \frac{1}{n_c}+\frac{1}{n_e}\right)\]

In this configuration, the \textbf{variance} of Glass's \(d_s\) is a function of the sample sizes of both control (\(n_c\)) and experimental (\(n_e\)) groups as well as of the sample sizes allocation ratio \(\left( \frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)\):

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Theoretical-Variance-of-all-estimators-as-a-function-of-population-parameters_files/figure-latex/varglassNsize2-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:varglassNsize2}Variance of Glass's \(d_s\), when variances are equal across groups, as a function of the total sample size (N).}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The larger the sample sizes, the lower the variance (Figure \ref{fig:varglassNsize2});
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

The sample sizes ratio associated with the lowest variance is not exactly 1 (because of the term \(\frac{df}{df-2}\), df depending only on \(n_c\)), but is very close to 1 (and the larger the total sample size, the closer to 1 is the sample sizes ratio associated with the lowest variance). The further from this sample size ratio, the larger the variance (see Figure \ref{fig:varglasshomNratio2}).

\hypertarget{when-delta_glass-neq-0}{%

\caption{\label{fig:ESmoderatorGlassNsize2}Effect size moderator, when computing the variance of Glass's \(d_s\), as a function of the size of the control group (left) and experimental group (right).}
\end{figure}

While the variance of Glass's \(d_s\) still depends on the total sample size and the sample sizes allocation ratio, it also depends on the population effect size (\(\delta_{Cohen}\)). The larger the population effect size, the larger the variance. However, the effect of the population effect size decreases when the control group increases. On the other side, the effect of the population effect size does \emph{not} depend on the size of the experimental group.

\[\lim_{n_c\rightarrow \infty}\left[\frac{df}{df-2} - \left( \frac{\sqrt{\frac{df}{2}} \times \Gamma \left(\frac{df-1}{2} \right)}{\Gamma \left( \frac{df}{2}\right)}\right)^2 \right]=0\]
\[\lim_{n_e\rightarrow \infty}\left[\frac{df}{df-2} - \left( \frac{\sqrt{\frac{df}{2}} \times \Gamma \left(\frac{df-1}{2} \right)}{\Gamma \left( \frac{df}{2}\right)}\right)^2 \right] \neq 0\]

These limits are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ESmoderatorGlassNsize2}.

\end{figure}

Note: while the sample sizes ratio associated with the lowest variance was very close to 1 with a null population effect size, this is not true anymore when the population effect size is not zero. Indeed, because of the second term in the adddition, when computing the variance, one gives much more weight to the effect size of the control group (see Figure \ref{fig:varglasshomNratiobis2}), and the larger the population effect size the truer. For example, when \(\delta_{glass}\)= 4, the lowest variance will occure when \(n_c\) is approximately 3 times larger than \(n_e\). When \(\delta_{glass}\)= 7, the lowest variance will occure when \(n_c\) is approximately 5 times larger than \(n_e\), etc.

\hypertarget{when-delta_glass0-1}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{When \(\delta_{Glass}=0\)}{When \textbackslash delta\_\{Glass\}=0}}\label{when-delta_glass0-1}}

When the population effect size is zero, the variance of Glass's \(d_s\) can be simplified as follows:

\[Var_{Glass's \; d_s} = \frac{n-1}{n(n-3)} \left( 1+\frac{\sigma^2_e}{\sigma^2_c}\right)\]

Where \(n=N/2\) = sample size of each group. The variance is therefore a function of the total sample size and the \(SD\)-ratio (\(\frac{\sigma_c}{\sigma_e}\)):

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The larger the \(SD\)-ratio (i.e.~the larger is \(\sigma_c\) in comparison with \(\sigma_e\)), the lower the variance (see Figure \ref{fig:varglasshetbalSDratio2}). However, the effect of the \(SD\)-ratio decreases when sample sizes increase, because \(\lim_{n(=n_c=n_e)\rightarrow \infty}\left[\frac{df}{n(df-2)} \right]=0\).

The larger the population effect size, the larger the variance. However, the effect of the population effect size decreases when the control group increases, as previously explained and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ESmoderatorGlassNsize2}.

When the population effect size is zero, the variance of Glass's \(d_s\) can be simplified as follows:

\[Var_{Glass's \; d_s} = \frac{n_c-1}{n_c-3} \left( \frac{1}{n_c}+\frac{\sigma^2_e}{n_e\sigma^2_c}\right)\]

The variance of Glass's \(d_s\) is therefore a function of the total sample size (N), the \(SD\)-ratio and the interaction between the sample sizes ratio and the \(SD\)-ratio \(\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\times\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right)\):

\caption{\label{fig:varglassHetunbalNsize2}Variance of Glass's \(d_s\), when variances and sample sizes are unequal across groups, as a function of the total sample sizes, when increasing only the control (right) or the experimental (left) group, when \(\sigma_c > \sigma_e\) (top plots) or \(\sigma_c < \sigma_e\) (bottom plots).}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Whatever the \(SD\) and sample sizes pairing, increasing \(n_c\) and/or \(n_e\) will decrease the variance (see Figure \ref{fig:varglassHetunbalNsize2});

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The effect of the sample sizes ratio depends on the \(SD\)-ratio:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      We previously mentioned that when \(\sigma_c=\sigma_e\), the variance is minimized when sample sizes of both groups are almost identical (see Figure \ref{fig:varglasshomNratio2}), meaning that it is more efficient, in order to reduce variance, to add subjects uniformly in both groups;\\
    \item
      When \(\sigma_e > \sigma_c\), more weight is given to \(n_e\), meaning that it is more efficient, in order to reduce variance, to add subjects in the experiental group (\(n_e\); see bottom plots in Figure \ref{fig:varglassHetunbalNsize2});\\
    \item
      When \(\sigma_c > \sigma_e\), less weight is given to \(n_e\), meaning that it is more efficient, in order to reduce variance, to add sujects in the control group (\(n_c\); see top plots in Figure \ref{fig:varglassHetunbalNsize2}).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Finally, there is also a main effect of the \(SD\)-ratio: the larger is \(\sigma_c\) in comparison with \(\sigma_e\), the lower the variance, as we can observe in Figure \ref{fig:varglasshetunbalSDratio2}. We can also notice that in Figure \ref{fig:varglassHetunbalNsize2}, the maximum variance is much larger in the two bottom plots (where \(\sigma_c<\sigma_e\)) than in the two top plots (where \(\sigma_c>\sigma_e\)).
\end{itemize}

Note that the effect of the \(SD\)-ratio, and the interaction effect between \(SD\)-ratio and sample sizes ratio decreases when the sample size of the control group increases (because \(\frac{n_c-1}{n_c-3}\) get closer to 1).

\hypertarget{when-delta_glass-neq-0-2}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{When \(\delta_{Glass} \neq 0\)}{When \textbackslash delta\_\{Glass\} \textbackslash neq 0}}\label{when-delta_glass-neq-0-2}}

While the variance of Glass's \(d_s\) still depends on the total sample size, the \(SD\)-ratio and the interaction between the \(SD\)-ratio and the sample sizes ratio, it also depends on the population effect size (\(\delta_{Glass}\)): the larger the population effect size, the larger the variance. However, the effect of the population effect size decreases when the sample size of the control group increases, as previously explained and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ESmoderatorGlassNsize2}.

Note: when the population effect size was null, when \(\sigma_c<\sigma_e\), it was much more efficient to add subjects in the experimental group in order to reduce the variance (because much more weight were given to \(n_e\)). When \(\delta_{Glass} \neq 0\), it is important to add subjects in both groups in order to reduce the variance (because \(\frac{df}{df-2} - \left( \frac{\sqrt{\frac{df}{2}} \times \Gamma \left(\frac{df-1}{2} \right)}{\Gamma \left( \frac{df}{2}\right)}\right)^2\) is only a function of the sample size of the control group). With huge population effect size, it is even always more important to add subjects in the control group (e.g.~when \(\delta_{Glass}=30\)).

\hypertarget{in-summary-1}{%
\subsubsection{In summary}\label{in-summary-1}}

The variance of Glass's \(d_s\) is a function of the population effect size (\(\delta_{Glass}\)), the \(SD\)-ratio, the total sample size and the interaction between sample sizes ratio and \(SD\)-ratio \(\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\times\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right)\):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variance decreases when the \(SD\)-ratio increases (i.e.~when \(\sigma_e >> \sigma_c\));\\
\item
  The variance always decreases when the control and/or the experimental groups increases. The benefit of adding subjects rather in the control, in the experimental, or in both groups, in order to reduce the variance, varies as a function of the \(SD\)-ratio and the population effect size. The only situation where it is optimal to maximize the experimental group is when \(\sigma_e > \sigma_c\) and \(\sigma_{glass} \approx 0\). Most of the time, it is more efficient to maximize the control groups (e.g.~anytime \(\sigma_e < \sigma_c\), and when \(\sigma_{Glass}\) is very large) or to uniformly add subjects in both groups (e.g.~when \(\sigma_e > \sigma_c\) and \(\delta_{Glass}\) with neither null nor huge). TRYING TO QUANTIFY WHAT I CALL HUGE.\\
\item
  The variance increases when \(\delta_{Glass}\) increases. Note that the effect of \(\delta_{Glass}\) is moderated by the control group size (the larger \(n_e\), the smaller the effect of \(\delta_{Glass}\) on the variance).
\end{itemize}

When the population effect size is zero, the variance of Cohen's \(d'_s\) is computed as following :

\[Var_{Cohen's \; d'_s} = \frac{df}{df-2} \times \frac{N}{n_1n_2}\]
with \[df = \frac{4(n_1-1)(n_2-1)}{n_1+n_2-2}\].

In this configuration, the degrees of freedom as well as the variance of Cohen's \(d'_s\) depends on the total sample size (N) and the sample size allocation ratio (\(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\)):

When the population effect size is zero, the variance of Cohen's \(d'_s\) can be simplified as follows:

\[Var_{Cohen's \; d'_s} = \frac{df}{df-2} \times \frac{2}{n}\]
Where \(n=N/2\)=sample size of each group, and \(df=\frac{(n-1)(\sigma^4_1+\sigma^4_2+2\sigma^2_1\sigma^2_2)}{\sigma^4_1+\sigma^4_2}\)

In this configuration, the degrees of freedom as well as the variance of Cohen's \(d_s\) depends on the total sample size (N) and the \(SD\)-ratio \(\left( \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}\right)\):

In this configuration, the degrees of freedom are a function of the total sample size (N) and the interaction between sample sizes ratio and the \(SD\)-ratio \(\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\times\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right)\):

Note: we previously noticed that when the effet size is zero, the variance of Shieh's \(d_s\) decreases, even when the sample sizes ratio increases.
