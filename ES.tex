\maketitle

Effect sizes are important issues in applied research. There is a strong call for researchers to report and interpret effect sizes and associated confidence intervals. This practice is also highly endorsed by the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Educational Research Association (AERA; American Psychological Association, 2010; American Educational Research Association, 2006).

In \enquote{between-subject} designs where individuals are randomly assigned into one of two independent groups and group scores are compared based on their means, the dominant estimator of effect size is Cohen's \(d_s\), where the sample mean difference is divided by the pooled sample standard deviation (Peng, Chen, Chiang, \& Chiang, 2013; Shieh, 2013). This estimator is available in many statistical softwares, such as SPSS or Stata. However, computing the pooled sample standard deviation implies that both sample variances are estimates of a common population variance, and it has been widely argued that there are many fields in psychology where the assumption of equal variances between two populations is ecologically unlikely (Delacre, Lakens, \& Leys, 2017; Erceg-Hurn \& Mirosevich, 2008; Grissom, 2000). The debate surrounding the assumption of equal variances has been widely explored in the context of hypothesis testing and it is becoming more common in statistical software to present a \emph{t}-test that does not hold under this assumption by default when performing hypothesis tests, namely the Welch's \emph{t}-test (e.g., R, Minitab). However, similar issues for the measures of effect sizes have received less attention. One possible reason is that researchers cannot find a consensus on which alternative should be used (Shieh, 2013). Even within the very specific context of standardized samples mean differences estimates, there is little agreement between researchers as to which is the most suitable estimator. In this article, we will review the main measures of the \emph{d}-family that are proposed in the literature, namely Cohen's \(d_s\), Glass's \(d_s\), Shieh's \(d_s\) and Cohen's \(d'_s\) where the sample mean difference is divided by the square root of the non poooled average of both sample variances. We will compare them through simulations and suggest that Cohen's \(d'_s\) is a better default than Cohen's \(d_s\). We will also provide practical recommandations and useful tools (i.e.~R package, Shiny app) to compute relevant measures of effects sizes, and confidence intervals around them as well as power functions to determine the require sample size for further well-powered studies.

Before reviewing the main measures of the \emph{d}-family, we will first list the different situations that call for effect sizes measures (and their link between effect size and both statistical and practical significance). We will also describe the properties of a good effect size estimators that we will take into account, in order to compare different estimators, in the Monte Carlo simulations.

\hypertarget{effect-size-definition-and-purposes}{%
\section{Effect size: definition and purposes}\label{effect-size-definition-and-purposes}}

The effect size is a measure of the magnitude of an effect. In the context of the comparison of two groups based on their means, when the null hypothesis is the absence of effect, \emph{d}-family effect size estimators estimate the magnitude of the differences between parameters of two populations groups are extracted from (e.g.~the mean; Peng \& Chen, 2014). Such a measure can be used in three different perspectives.

First, effect size measures can be used for \emph{interpretative} purposes, namely to assess the practical significance of a result (i.e.~all what refers to the relevance of an effect in real life, such as clinical, personnal, social, professionnal relevance). Note, however, that in this context, it is important not to overestimate the contribution of the measures of effect size: effect size is \textbf{not} a measure of the importance or the relevance of an effect in real life (even if benchmarks about what should be a small, medium or large effect size might have contributed to viewing the effect size as so; Stout \& Ruble, 1995). It is only a mathematical indicator of the magnitude of a difference, which depends on the way a variable is converted into numerical indicator. In order to assess the meaningfulness of an effect, we should be able to relate this effect size estimate with behaviors/meaningful consequences in the real world (Andersen, McCullagh, \& Wilson, 2007). For example, let us imagine a sample of students in serious school failure who are randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group following a training program and a control group. At the end of the training, students in the experimental group have on average significantly higher scores on a test than students in the control group, and the difference is large (e.g.~30 percents). Does it automatically mean that students in the experimental condition will be able to pass to the next grade and to continue normal schooling? Whether the computed magnitude of difference is an important, meaningful change in everyday life refers to the interpretation of treatment outcomes and is neither a statistical nor mathematical concept, but is related to the underlying theory that posits an empirical hypothesis.

Second, effect size measures can be used for \emph{comparative} purposes, that is, to assess the stability of results across designs, analysis, samples sizes. This includes the comparison of results from 2 or more studies and the incorporation of results in meta-analysis.

Third, effect size measures can be used for \emph{inferential} purposes. The effect sizes from previous studies can be used in a prior power analysis when planning a new study (Lakens, 2013; Prentice \& Miller, 1990; Stout \& Ruble, 1995; Sullivan \& Feinn, 2012; Wilkinson \& the Task Force on Statistical Inference, 1999). Moreover, while point effect size estimators should not replace the null hypothesis testing by themselves (Fan, 2001) \footnote{Statistical testing and point effect size estimates don't answer the same question. Statistical testing allows the researcher to determine whether data are surprisingly different from what it expected under the null, while effect size estimators allow to assess the practical signficance of an effect, and as reminds Fan(2001):  "a practically meaningful outcome may also have occured by chance, and consequently, is not trustworthy" (p.278)}, conventional hypothesis testing and confidence interval around a point estimate are equivalent decision procedures. A confidence interval contains all the information that a \(p\)-value of a test based on the same estimator does: if the area of the null hypothesis is out of the \((1-\alpha)\)-confidence interval, then the hypothesis test would also result in a \emph{p}-value below the nominal alpha level. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on the same statistical quantity (this is an essential requirement) are thus directly related. At the same time, the intervals provide extra information about the precision of the sample estimate for inferential purposes, and therefore on how confident we can be in the observed results (Altman, 2005; Ellis, 2015): the narrower the interval, the higher the precision. On the other hand, the wider the confidence interval, the more the data lacks precision (for example, because the sample size is too small).

\hypertarget{properties-of-a-good-effect-size-estimator}{%
\section{Properties of a good effect size estimator}\label{properties-of-a-good-effect-size-estimator}}

The empirical value of an estimator (called estimate) depends on the sampling, in other words, different samples extracted from the same population will of course lead to different estimates (i.e.~sample effect size; \(\hat{\delta}\)) for a same estimator (i.e.~population effect size; \(\delta\)). The \emph{sampling distribution} of the estimator is the distribution of all estimates, based on all possible samples of size \emph{n} extracted from one population. Studying the sampling distribution is very useful, as it allows us to assess the qualities of estimator. More specifically, three desirable properties a good estimator should possess for inferential purposes are: \textbf{unbiasedness}, \textbf{consistency} and \textbf{efficiency} (Wackerly, Mendenhall, \& Scheaffer, 2008).

An estimator is unbiased if the distribution of estimates is centered around the true population parameter. On the other hand, an estimator is positively (or negatively) biased if the distribution is centered around a value that is higher (or lower) than the true population parameter (see Figure \ref{fig:BIAS}). In other words, the bias tells us if estimates are accurate, on average. The \emph{bias} of a point estimator \(\delta\) can be computed as

\begin{equation} 
\delta_{bias}=E(\hat{\delta})-\delta
\label{eq:BIAS}
\end{equation}

where \(E(\hat{\delta})\) is the expectation of the sampling distribution of the estimator and \(\delta\) is the true (population) parameter.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=400px]{ES_files/figure-latex/BIAS-1} \caption{Samplig distribution for a positively biased (left), an unbiased (center) and a negatively biased estimator (right)}\label{fig:BIAS}
\end{figure}

As we can see in Tables 1 and 2, the bias is directly related with the population effect size: the larger the population effect size, the larger the bias. It might therefore be interesting to also define the \emph{relative bias} as the ratio between the bias and the population effect size:

\begin{equation} 
\hat{\delta}_{relative \; bias}=\frac{E(\hat{\delta})-\delta}{\delta}
\label{eq:RELBIAS}
\end{equation}

While the bias informs us about the quality of estimates on average, in particular their capacity of lying close to the true value, it says nothing about individual estimates. Imagine a situation where the distribution of estimates is centered around the real parameter but with such a large variance that some point estimates are very far from the center. This would be problematic, since we then do not know if this estimate, based on the sample at hand, is close to the truth or far off. Therefore it is not only essential for an estimator to be unbiased, but the variability of its sampling distribution should also ideally be small. Put simply, we hope that \emph{all} possible estimates are close enough of the true population parameter, in order to be sure that for \emph{any} estimate, one has a correct estimation of the real parameter. Among two unbiased estimators \(\hat{\delta_1}\) and \(\hat{\delta_2}\), we therefore say that \(\hat{\delta_1}\) is \textbf{more efficient} than \(\hat{\delta_2}\) if

\begin{equation} 
Var(\hat{\delta}_1) \leq Var(\hat{\delta}_2)
\label{eq:EFFICIENCY}
\end{equation}

Where \(Var(\hat{\delta})\) is the variance of the sampling distribution of the estimator \(\hat{\delta}\). Among all unbiased estimators, the more efficient will be the one with the smallest variance \footnote{The Cramer-Rao inequality provides a theoretical lower bound for the variance of unbiased estimators. An estimator reaching this bound is therefore most efficient.}. Again, the variance of an estimator \(\hat{\delta}\) is a function of its size (the larger the estimator, the larger the variance) and therefore, we might be interested in reducing the effect size impact in computing the \emph{relative variance} as the ratio between the variance and the square of the population estimator:

\begin{equation} 
\hat{\delta}_{relative \; variance}=\frac{Var(\hat{\delta})}{\delta^2}
\label{eq:RELVAR}
\end{equation}

Note that both unbiasedness and efficiency are very important. An unbiased estimator with such a large variance that somes estimates are extremely far from the real parameter is as undesirable as a parameter which is highly biased. In some situations, it is better to have a slightly biased estimator with a tight shape around the biased value (so that each estimate remains relatively close to the true parameter and one can apply bias correction techniques) rather than an unbiased estimator with a large variance (Raviv, 2014).

Finally, the last property of a good point estimator is \textbf{consistency}: consistency means that the bigger the sample size, the closer the estimate is to the population parameter. In other words, the estimates \emph{converge} to the true population parameter.

Beyond the inferential properties, Cumming (2013) reminds that an effect size estimator needs to have a constant value across designs, in order to be easily interpretable and to be included in meta-analysis. In other words, it should achieve the property of \textbf{generality}. To our concern, while we focus on between subjects designs, we expect to highlight an estimate of the population effect size with a constant value for any sample sizes ratio.

\hypertarget{different-measures-of-effect-sizes}{%
\section{Different measures of effect sizes}\label{different-measures-of-effect-sizes}}

The \emph{d}-family effect sizes are commonly used for mean differences between groups or conditions. The population effect size is defined as

\begin{equation} 
\delta = \frac{\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}}{\sigma} 
\label{eq:Cohendelta}
\end{equation}

where both populations follow a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_j\) in the \(j^{th}\) population (j=1,2) and common standard deviation \(\sigma\). They exist different estimators of this effect size measure. For all of them, the mean difference is estimated by the difference \(\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2\) of both sample means. When the equality of variances assumption is assumed, \(\sigma\) is estimated by pooling both samples standard deviations (\(S_1\) and \(S_2\)). When the equality of variances assumption cannot be assumed, alternatives to the common standard deviation are available. Throughout this section, we will present some of these estimators, separately depending on whether they rely on the assumption of equality of variances or not. For each of them, we will provide information about their theoretical bias, variance and consistency.

\hypertarget{when-variances-are-equal-between-groups}{%
\subsection{When variances are equal between groups}\label{when-variances-are-equal-between-groups}}

When we have good reasons to assume equality of variances between groups, then the most common estimator of \(\delta\) is Cohen's \(d_{s}\) where the sample mean difference is divided by a pooled error term (Cohen, 1965):
\begin{equation} 
Cohen's \; d_s = \frac{\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1) \times S_1^2+(n_2-1) \times S_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}}
\label{eq:Cohends}
\end{equation}

Where \(S_j\) is the standard deviation and \(n_j\) the sample size of the \(j^{th}\) sample (j=1,2). The reasoning behind this measure is to make use of the fact that both samples share the same population variance (Keselman, Algina, Lix, Deering, \& Wilcox, 2008), hence we achieve a more accurate estimation of the population variance by pooling both estimates of this parameter (i.e \(S_1\) and \(S_2\)). Since the larger the sample size, the more accurate the estimate, we give more weight to the estimate based on the larger sample size. Cohen's \(d_{s}\) is directly related with Student's \emph{t}-statistic:

\begin{equation} 
t_{student}=\frac{cohen's \; d_s}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}}\leftrightarrow cohen's \; d_s =  t_{student} \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}
\label{eq:Cohenvsstudent}
\end{equation}

Under the assumption of normality and equal variances between groups, Student's \emph{t}-statistic follows a \emph{t}-distribution with known degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter \footnote{Under the null hypothesis of no differences between sample means, Student's $t$-statistic will follow a central $t$-distribution with $n_1+n_2-2$ degrees of freedom. However, when the null hypothesis is false, the distribution of this quantity will not be centered, and noncentral $t$-distribution will arise.}:

\begin{equation} 
df_{student} = n_1+n_2-2
\label{eq:studentdf}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
ncp_{student} = \frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{\sigma_{pooled} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}} \; where \; \sigma_{pooled}= \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1) \times \sigma^2_1+(n_2-1) \times \sigma^2_2}{n_1+n_2-2}}
\label{eq:studentncp}
\end{equation}

The relationship described in equation \ref{eq:Cohenvsstudent} and the theoretical distribution of Student's \emph{t}-statistic allow us to theoretically determine the sampling distribution of Cohen's \(d_s\), and therefore, its theoretical expectancy and variance when the assumptions of normality and equal variances are met. All these equations are provided in Table 1. For interested readers, we have theoretically studied the bias and variance of Cohen's \(d_s\) based on Table 1 (as well as the bias and variance of all other estimators described later, based on Tables 2 and 3) in Supplemental Material 1 \footnote{All supplemental Materials are available on Github: https://github.com/mdelacre/Effect-sizes/}, so as to determine the way different parameters influence them. Main results will be illustrated in a later section called \enquote{Monte Carlo Simulations: assessing the bias, efficiency and consistency of 5 estimators} .

While Cohen's \(d_s\) is a consistent estimator, its bias and variance are substantial with small sample sizes, even under the assumptions of normality and equal variances (Lakens, 2013). In order to compensate for Cohen's \(d_s\) bias with small sample sizes, Hedges \& Olkin (1985) has defined a bias-corrected version:

\begin{equation} 
Hedges' \; g_s = Cohen's \; d_s \times \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df_{Student}}{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{df_{Student}}{2}} \times \Gamma(\frac{df_{Student}-1}{2})}
\label{eq:Hedgesgs}
\end{equation}

Where \(df_{Student}\) has been defined in equation \ref{eq:studentdf},and \(\Gamma()\) is the gamma function (for integers, \(\Gamma(x)\) is the factorial of x minus 1: \(\Gamma(x)\)=(x-1)!; Goulet-Pelletier \& Cousineau, 2018). This equation can be approximated as follows:

\begin{equation} 
Hedges' \; g_s = Cohen's \; d_s \times \left( 1- \frac{3}{4N -9} \right)
\label{eq:Hedgesgsapprox}
\end{equation}

Hedges' \(g_s\) is theoretically unbiased when the assumptions of normality and equal variances are met (see Table 1). Moreover, while the variance of both Cohen's \(d_s\) and Hedges' \(g_s\) depend on the same parameters (i.e.~the total sample size (N) and the sample sizes ratio \(\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)\)), Hedges' \(g_s\) is less variable, especially with small sample sizes \footnote{$.52 \le \left[\frac{\Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{df}{2}} \times \Gamma(\frac{df-1}{2})} \right] ^2 < 1$ for $3 \le df < \infty$. The larger the total sample size, the smaller the difference between the variance of Cohen's $d_s$ and Hedges' $g_s$.}.

While the pooled error term is the best choice when variances are equal between groups (Grissom \& Kim, 2001), it may not be well advised for use with data that violate this assumption (Cumming, 2013; Grissom \& Kim, 2001, 2005; Kelley, 2005, 2005; Shieh, 2013). When variances are unequal between groups, the expression in equation \ref{eq:Cohendelta} is no longer valid because both groups don't share a common population variance. If we pool the estimates of two unequal population variances, the estimator of effect size will be lower as it should be in case of positive pairing (i.e.~the group with the larger sample size is extracted from the population with the larger variance) and larger as it should be in case of negative pairing (i.e.~the group with the larger sample size is extracted from the population with the smaller variance). Because the assumption of equal variances across populations is very rare in practice (Cain, Zhang, \& Yuan, 2017; Delacre et al., 2017; Delacre, Leys, Mora, \& Lakens, 2019; Erceg-Hurn \& Mirosevich, 2008; Glass, Peckham, \& Sanders, 1972; Grissom, 2000; Micceri, 1989; Yuan, Bentler, \& Chan, 2004), both Cohen's \(d_s\) and Hedges' \(g_s\) should be abandoned in favor of an alternative robust to unequal population variances.

Moreover, the larger the population estimator (\(\delta\)), the larger the bias. Indeed, the bias is the difference between the expectancy and \(\delta\): \(\delta_{bias} = \delta_{Cohen} \times (c_f-1)\). On the other hand, Hedges' \(g_s\) is an unbiased estimator, because its expectation equals the population effect size; equations in Table 1 require \(df \ge 3\) (i.e.~\(N \ge 5\)).

\subsection{When variances are unequal between populations}\label{when-variances-are-unequal-between-populations}}

In his review, Shieh (2013) mentions three options available in the literature to deal with the case of unequal variances: the sample mean difference divided by (A) the Glass's \(d_s\), (B) the Shieh's \(d_s\) and (C) the non pooled average of both variance estimates.

\hypertarget{glasss-d_s}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Glass's \(d_s\)}{Glass's d\_s}}\label{glasss-d_s}}

When comparing one control group with one experimental group, Glass, McGav, \& Smith (2005) recommend using the standard deviation \(SD\) of the control group as standardizer. It is also advocated by Cumming (2013), because, according to him, it is what makes the most sense, conceptually speaking. This yields

\begin{equation} 
Glass's \; d_s = \frac{\bar{X}_{e} - \bar{X}_{c}}{S_{c}}
\label{eq:Glassds}
\end{equation}

Where \(\bar{X}_{e} \; and \; \bar{X}_{c}\) are respectively the sample means of the experimental and control groups, and \(S_{c}\) is the sample SD of the control group. One argument in favour of using the \(SD\) of the control group as standardizer is the fact that it is not affected by the experimental treatment. When it is easy to identify which group is the \enquote{control} one, it is therefore convenient to compare the effect size estimation of different designs studying the same effect. However, defining this group is not always obvious (Coe, 2002). This could induce large ambiguity because depending of the chosen \(SD\) as standardizer, measures could be substantially diÔ¨Äerent (Shieh, 2013). The distribution of Glass's \(d_{s}\) is defined as following (Algina, Keselman, \& Penfield, 2006):

\begin{equation} 
Glass's \; d_s \sim \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{c}}+\frac{S_{e}^2}{n_{e} \times S^2_{c}}} \times t_{df,ncp}
\label{eq:glassvst}
\end{equation}

Where \(n_c\) and \(n_e\) are respectively the sample sizes of the control and experimental groups, and \(df\) and \(ncp\) are defined as follows:

\begin{equation} 
df = n_{c}-1
\label{eq:glassdf}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
ncp = \frac{\mu_{c}-\mu_{e}}{\sigma_{c} \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{c}} + \frac{\sigma_{e}^2}{n_{e} \times \sigma^2_{c}}}}
\label{eq:glassdf}
\end{equation}

Where \(\mu_c\) and \(\mu_e\) are respectively the mean of the populations control and experimental groups are extracted from. Thanks to equation \ref{eq:glassvst}, we can compute its theoretical expectancy and variance when the assumptions of normality is met (See Table 2), and therefore determine which factors influence bias and variance, and how they do so (see Supplemental Material 1).

\hypertarget{shiehs-d_s}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Shieh's \(d_s\)}{Shieh's d\_s}}\label{shiehs-d_s}}

Kulinskaya \& Staudte (2007) were the first to advice the use of a standardizer that takes the sample sizes allocation ratios into account, in addition to the variance of both samples. Shieh (2013), following Kulinskaya \& Staudte (2007), proposed a modification of the exact \emph{SD} of the sample mean difference:

\begin{equation} 
Shieh's \; d_s = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{S_1^2/q_1+S_2^2/q_2}}; \;\;\; q_j=\frac{n_j}{N} (j=1,2)
\label{eq:Shiehds}
\end{equation}

Where \(N = n_1+n_2\). Shieh's \(d_{s}\) is directly related with Welch's \emph{t}-statistic:

\begin{equation} 
Shieh's \; d_s=\frac{t_{Welch}}{\sqrt{N}}\leftrightarrow t_{welch} = Shieh's \; d_s \times \sqrt{N}
\label{eq:shiehvswelch}
\end{equation}

The exact distribution of Welch's \emph{t}-statistic is more complicated than the exact distribution of Student's \emph{t}-statistic, but it follows a \emph{t}-distribution with degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameters that can be approximated as follows, under the assumption of normality (Shieh, 2013; Welch, 1938):

\begin{equation} 
df_{Welch} \approx \frac{\left(\frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2} \right)^2}{\frac{(\sigma^2_1/n_1)^2}{n_1-1}+\frac{(\sigma^2_2/n_2)^2}{n_2-1}}
\label{eq:welchdf}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
ncp_{Welch} = \frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1/N}+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2/N}}} \times \sqrt{N} = \frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n1}+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}
\label{eq:welchncp}
\end{equation}

The relationship described in equation \ref{eq:shiehvswelch} and the theoretical distribution of Welch's \emph{t}-statistic allow us to theoretically approximate the sampling distribution of Shieh's \(d_s\). Based on the sampling distribution of Shieh's \(d_s\), we can estimate its theoretical expectancy and variance under the assumption of normality (see Table 2), and therefore determine which factors influence bias and variance, and how they do so (see Supplemental Material 1).

It can be demonstrated that when variances and sample sizes are equal across groups, the biases and variances of Shieh's \(d_s\) and Cohen's \(d_s\) are identical except for a constant, as shown in equations \ref{eq:biascohenshieh} and \ref{eq:varcohenshieh}:

\begin{equation} 
Shieh's \; d_{s,bias} = 2 \times Cohen's \; d_{s,bias} \;\;\;(considering \; \sigma_1 = \sigma_2 \; and \; n_1 = n_2)
\label{eq:biascohenshieh}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
Shieh's \; d_{s,variance} = 4 \times Cohen's \; d_{s,variance} \;\;\;(considering \; \sigma_1 = \sigma_2 \; and \; n_1 = n_2)
\label{eq:varcohenshieh}
\end{equation}

Due to the relation described in equation \ref{eq:cohenshieh} when sample sizes are equal between groups, such proportions mean that relative to their respective true effect size, Cohen's \(d_s\) and Shieh's \(d_s\) are equally good. This is a good illustration of the fact that biases and variances should always be studied relative to the population effect size (and not in absolute terms), as we will do later.

\begin{equation} 
Shieh's \; \delta_{n_1=n_2}= \frac{Cohen's \; \delta_{n_1=n_2}}{2}
\label{eq:cohenshieh}
\end{equation}

Except for this very specific situation, according to the statistical properties of Welch's statistic under heteroscedasticity, Shieh's \(d_s\) accounts for the sample sizes allocation ratio. The lack of generality caused by taking this specificity of the design into account has led Cumming (2013) to question its usefulness in terms of interpretability: when keeping constant the mean difference (\(\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}\)) as well as \(SD_1\) and \(SD_2\), Shieh's \(d_s\) will vary as a function of the sample sizes allocation ratio (unlike Cohen's \(d'_s\) that we will describe later).The dependency of Shieh's \(d_s\) value on the sample sizes allocation ratio is illustrated in the following shiny application: \url{https://mdelacre.shinyapps.io/shiehvscohen/}.

\hypertarget{cohens-d_s}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Cohen's \(d'_s\)}{Cohen's d'\_s}}\label{cohens-d_s}}

The sample mean difference, divided by the square root of the non pooled average of both variance estimates was suggested by Welch (1938). This yields:

\begin{equation} 
Cohen's \; d'_s = \frac{\bar{X}_{1} - \bar{X}_{2}}{ \sqrt{\frac{\left(S^2_{1}+S^2_{2} \right)}{2}}}
\label{eq:cohenprimeds}
\end{equation}

Where \(\bar{X}_{j}\) is the mean and \(S_j\) is the standard deviation of the \(j^{th}\) sample (j = 1,2). We know the distribution of Cohen's \(d'_{s}\) (Huynh, 1989):

\begin{equation} 
Cohen's \; d'_s \sim  \sqrt{\frac{2(n_2\times\sigma^2_1+n1\times\sigma^2_2)}{n_1n_2(\sigma^2_1+\sigma^2_2)}} \times t_{df^*,ncp^*}
\label{eq:cohendprimedist}
\end{equation}

Where \(df^*\) and \(ncp^*\) are defined as follows:

\begin{equation} 
df^* = \frac{(n_1-1)(n_2-1)(s^2_1+s^2_2)^2}{(n_2-1)s^4_1+(n_1-1)s^4_2}
\label{eq:cohendprimedf}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
ncp^*=\frac{(\mu_1-\mu_2)\sqrt{n_1n_2}}{\sqrt{n_2\sigma^2_1+n_1\sigma^2_2}}=\frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2_1+\sigma^2_2}{2}}} \times \sqrt{\frac{n_1n_2(\sigma^2_1+\sigma^2_2)}{2(n_2\sigma^2_1+n_1\sigma^2_2)}}
\label{eq:cohendprimevst}
\end{equation}

Thanks to equation \ref{eq:cohendprimevst}, we can compute its theoretical expectancy and variance when the assumptions of normality is met (See Table 2), and therefore determine which factors influence bias and variance, and how they do so (see Supplemental Material 1). This estimator has been widely criticized, because:\\
- it results in a variance term of an artificial population (i.e.~since the variance term does not estimate the variance of one or the other group, the composit variance is an estimation of the variance of an artificial population) and is therefore very difficult to interpret (Grissom \& Kim, 2001);\\
- unless both sample sizes are equal, the variance term does not correspond to the variance of the mean difference (Shieh, 2013).

However, we will show throughout the simulation section that this estimator shows very good inferential properties. Moreover, it has a constant value across sample sizes ratios, as shown in the previously introduced Shiny App.

\hypertarget{glasss-g_s-shiehs-g_s-and-hedges-g_s}{%

As for Cohen's \(d_s\), an Hedges' correction can be applied in order to compensate for the bias of Glass's \(d_s\), Shieh's \(d_s\) and Cohen's \(d'_s\) with small sample sizes (see Table 2). This correction has the following general form:

\begin{equation} 
g_s = d_s \times \frac{\Gamma(\frac{\nu}{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{\nu}{2}} \times \Gamma(\frac{\nu-1}{2})}
\label{eq:Hedgesgs}
\end{equation}

Where \(\nu\) are provided in equation \ref{eq:glassdf} for Glass's \(g_s\), in equation \ref{eq:cohendprimedf} for Hedges' \(g'_s\) and in equation \ref{eq:welchdf} for Shieh's \(g_s\). The three corrected estimators are theoretically unbiased when the assumptions of normality is met. Their variance is a function of the same parameters as their biased equivalent, however, due to the correction, they have a smaller variance, especially with small sample size, as shown in Table 3. In summary:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variances of Hedges' \(g'_s\) and Shieh's \(g_s\) depend on the total sample size (\(N\)), their respective population effect size (\(\delta\)), and the interaction between the sample sizes ratio and the \(SD\)-ratio \(\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\times\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right)\).\\
\item
  The variance of Glass's \(g_s\) also depends on \(N\), \(\delta\) and \(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\times\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}\). In addition, there is also a main effect of the \(SD\)-ratio \(\left(\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right)\) on its variance.
\end{itemize}

How these parameters influence the variance of the estimators will be summarized and illustrated in the section dedicated to the Monte Carlo simulations.

\paragraph{Method}\label{method}}

We performed Monte Carlo simulations using R (version 3.5.0) to assess the bias, efficiency and consistency of Cohen's \(g_s\), Glass's \(g_s\) (using respectively the sample \(SD\) of the first or second group as a standardizer), Hedges' \(g'_s\) and Shieh's \(g_s\).

A set of 100,000 datasets were generated for 1,008 scenarios as a function of different criterions that will be explained below. In 252 scenarios, samples were extracted from a normally distributed population (in order to insure the reliability of our calculation method) and in 756 scenarios, samples were extracted from non normal population distributions. In order to assess the quality of estimators under realistic deviations from the normality assumption, we referred to the review of Cain et al. (2017). Cain et al.~(2017) investigated 1,567 univariate distributions from 194 studies published by authors in Psychological Science (from January 2013 to June 2014) and the American Education Research Journal (from January 2010 to June 2014). For each distribution, they computed the Fisher's skewness (G1) and kurtosis (G2):
\begin{equation} 
G_{1}=\frac{\sqrt{n(n-1)}}{n-2} \frac{m_{3}}{\sqrt{(m_{2})^3}}
\label{eq:skew}
\end{equation}

with n = sample size, \(m_{2}\) = second centered moment and \(m_{3}\) = third centered moment.

\begin{equation} 
G_{2}=\frac{n-1}{(n-2)(n-3)}\times [(n+1)(\frac{m_{4}}{(m_{2})^2}-3)+6]
\label{eq:kurt}
\end{equation}

with n = sample size and \(m_{2}\) and \(m_{4}\) = the second and fourth centered moments. They found values of kurtosis from G2 = -2.20 to 1,093.48. According to their suggestions, throughout our simulations, we kept constant the population kurtosis value at the 99th percentile of their distribution of kurtosis, i.e.~G2=95.75. Regarding skewness, we simulated population parameter values which correspond to the 1st and 99th percentile of their distribution of skewness, i.e.~respectively G1 = -2.08 and G1 = 6.32. We also simulated samples extracted from population where G1 = 0, in order to assess the main effect of high kurtosis on the quality of estimators. All possible combinations of population skewness and kurtosis and the number of scenarios for each combination are summarized in Table 4.

\emph{Note.} Fisher's skewness (G1) and kurtosis (G2) are presented in Table 4. The 252 combinations where both G1 and G2 equal 0 correspond to the normal case.

For the 4 resulting combinations of skewness and kurtosis (see Table 4), all other parameter values were chosen in order to illustrate the consequences of factors identified as playing a key role on the variance of unbiased estimators. We manipulated the population mean difference (\(\mu_1-\mu_2\)), the sample sizes (\emph{n}), the sample size ratio (\emph{n}-ratio = \(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\)), the population \emph{SD}-ratio (i.e.~\(\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}\)), and the sample size and population variance pairing \(\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\times\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right)\). In our scenarios, \(\mu_2\) was always 0 and \(\mu_1\) varied from 1 to 4, in step of 1 (so does \(\mu_1-\mu_2\))\footnote{In the original plan, we had added 252 simulations in which $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ were both null. We decided not to present the results of these simulations in the main article, because the relative bias and the relative variance appeared to us to be very useful to fully understand the estimators comparison, and computing them is impossible when the real mean difference is zero. However, these extra simulations were included in the simulations checks, in Supplemental Material 2. They were also used in order to compute confidence intervals around estimates when the population effect size is null.}. Moreover, \(\sigma_1\) always equals 1, and \(\sigma_2\) equals .1, .25, .5, 1, 2, 4 or 10 (so does \(\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}\)). The simulations for which both \(\sigma_1\) and \(\sigma_2\) equal 1 are the particular case of homoscedasticity (i.e.~equal population variances across groups). Sample size of both groups (\(n_1\) and \(n_2\)) were 20, 50 or 100. When sample sizes of both groups are equal, the \emph{n}-ratio equals 1 (this is known as a balanced design). All possible combinations of \emph{n}-ratio and population \emph{SD}-ratio were performed in order to distinguish scenarios where both sample sizes and population variances are unequal across groups (with positive pairing when the group with the largest sample size is extracted from the population with the largest \emph{SD}, and negative pairing when the group with the smallest sample size is extracted from the population with the smallest \emph{SD}) and scenarios with no pairing between sample sizes and variances (sample sizes and/or population \emph{SD} are equal across all groups). In sum, the simulations grouped over different sample sizes yield 4 conditions (a, b, c and d) based on the \emph{n}-ratio, population \emph{SD}-ratio, and sample size and population variance pairing, as summarized in Table 5. We chose to divide scenarios into these 4 conditions because analyzes in Supplemental Material 1 revealed a main effect of both sample sizes ratio and \(SD\)-ratio as well as an interaction effect on biases and variances of some estimators.

Before detailing estimators comparison for each condition, it might be interesting to make some general comments.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  We previously introduced the fact that raw bias and variances are sometimes misleading. They can give the illusion of huge differences between two estimators, even if these differences only reflect a change of unit (i.e.~different population effect sizes). To better understand this, imagine a sample of 15 people for whom we know the height (in meters) and we compute a sample variance of 0.06838. If we convert sizes to centimeters and compute the sample variance again, we find a measure of 683.8 (i.e.~\(10^3\) larger). Both measures represent the same amount of variability, but they are expressed in different units. Similar things occur when comparing the estimates of different population measures. To avoid this possible confusion, we will only present the relative bias and relative variance in all Figures (and anytime we will mention the biases and variances in the results section, we will be referring to relative bias and variance). For interested reader, illustrations of the raw bias and variance are available on Github.
\item
  In a purpose of readability, we used different scales for the ordinate axis of our plots that compare the relative bias of all estimators when \(G_1 = 6.32\) and \(G_2 = 95.75\), in comparisons with all other conditions. Indeed, relative biases are much larger for this specific combination \(G_1/G_2\). In the same way of thinking, we also used different scales for the ordinate axis of our plots that compare the relative variance of all estimators, as a function of the condition.
\item
  Throughout this section, we will \textbf{compare} the relative bias and variance of different estimators. We chose very extreme (although realistic) conditions, and we know that none of the parametric measures of effect size will be robust against such extreme conditions. Our goal is therefore to study the robustness of the estimators against normality violations only in comparison with the robustness of other indicators, but not in absolute terms.
\end{enumerate}

After these general remarks, we will analyze each condition separately. In all Figures presented below, for different sub-conditions, the averaged relative bias and relative variance of five estimators are presented. When describing the Glass's \(g_s\) estimators, we will systematically call \enquote{control group} the group the standardizer is computed from (i.e.~the first group when using \(SD_1\) as standardizer, the second group when using \(SD_2\) as standardizer). The other group will be called \enquote{experimental group}.

\end{sidewaysfigure}

Figures \ref{fig:idHombal} and \ref{fig:idHomunbal} represent configurations where the equality of variances assumption is met. According to our expectations, one observes that the bias of all estimators is approximately zero as long as the normality assumption is met (first column in both Figures)\footnote{When looking at the relative bias for all estimators, the maximum departure from zero is 0.0064 when sample sizes are equal across groups, and 0.0065 with unequal sample sizes.}. However, the further from the normality assumption (i.e.~when moving from left to right in Figures), the larger the bias.

Figure \ref{fig:idHombal} illustrates scenarios where both population variances and sample sizes are equal across groups (condition a). One can first notice that all estimators are consistent, as their bias and variance decrease when the total sample size increase. For any departure from the normality assumption, both bias and variance of Hedges' \(g_s\), Shieh's \(d_s\) and Hedges' \(g'_s\) are similar\footnote{While the bias and variance of Cohen's $d_s$, Cohen's $d'_s$ and Shieh's $d_s$ are identical, the bias and variance of Hedges' $g_s$ is marginally different than the bias and variance of Hedges' $g'_s$ and Shieh's $g_s$ (these last two having identical bias and variance). Indeed, because of the sampling error, differences remain between sample variances, even when population variances are equal groups. Because the Hedges' correction applied to Cohen's $d_s$ does not imply the sample variances (unlike the one applied on both other estimators), the bias and variance of Hedges' $g_s$ is slighly different than the bias and variance of Hedges' $g'_s$ and Shieh's $g_s$} and smaller than the bias and variance of glass's \(g_s\) estimates using either \(S_1\) or \(S_2\) as standardizer. Moreover, when samples are extracted from skewed distributions, Glass's \(g_s\) will show different bias and variance as a function of the chosen standardizer (\(S_1\) or \(S_2\)), even if both \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are estimates of the same population variance, based on the same sample size. This is due to non-null correlations of opposite sign between the mean difference (\(\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}\)) and respectively \(S_1\) and \(S_2\). For interested reader, when a non nul correlation occurs between the sample means difference (\(\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}\)) and the standardizer of compared estimators as well as the way this correlation impacts the bias and variance of estimators is detailed in Supplemental Material 3.

Figure \ref{fig:idHomunbal} illustrates scenarios where population variances are equal across groups and sample sizes are unequal (condition b). For any departures from the normality assumptions, Hedges' \(g_s\) shows the smallest bias and variance. Hedges' \(g_s\) and Hedges' \(g'_s\) are consistent estimators (i.e.~the larger the sample sizes, the lower the bias and the variance), unlike Shieh's \(g_s\) and Glass's \(g_s\). The bias of Glass's \(g_s\) does not depend either on the size of the experimental group or on the total sample size. The only way to decrease the bias of Glass's \(g_s\) is therefore to add subjects in the control group. On the other hand, the variance of Glass's \(g_s\) depends on both sample sizes, but not in an equivalent way: in order to reduce the variance, it is much more efficient to add subjects in the control group and when the size of the experimental group decreases so does the variance, even when the total sample size is increased. Regarding Shieh's \(g_s\), for a given sample size ratio,the bias and variance will decrease when sample sizes increase. However, there is a large effect of the sample sizes ratio in order that when the sample sizes ratio moves away from 1 by adding subjects, bias and variance might increase.\footnote{Regarding variance, in Supplemental Material 1, we mentioned that when the population effect size is nul, the larger the total sample size, the lower the variance, whatever the sample sizes ratio is constant or not. We also mentioned that this is no longer true when the population effect size is not zero and in our simulations, the effect size is never zero. The effect size effect is partially visible in Figure \ref{fig:idHomunbal} because we do not entirely remove the effect size effect when we divide the variance by $\delta^2$. This is due to the fact that one term, in the equation of the variance computation, does not depend on the effect size.} On the other side, when the sample sizes ratio moves closer to 1 by adding subjects, the bias will decrease.

When samples are extracted from skewed distributions and have unequal sizes (i.e.~\(n_1 \neq n_2\), the two last columns in Figure \ref{fig:idHomunbal}), for a constant total sample size, \(Glass's \; g_s\), Shieh's \(g_s\) and Hedges' \(g_s\) will show different bias and variance depending on which group is the largest one (e.g.~when distributions are right-skewed, the bias and variance of all these estimators when \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are respectively 50 and 20 are not the same as their bias and variance when \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are respectively 20 and 50). This is due to a non-null correlations of opposite sign between the mean difference (\(\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}\)) and their respective standardizers depending on which group is the largest one, as detailed in Supplemental Material 3. One observes that under these configurations, the bias and variance of Glass's \(g_s\) are sometimes a bit smaller and sometimes much larger than the bias and variance of Shieh's \(g_s\) and Cohen's \(d'_s\). \footnote{We learn from Supplemental Material 3 that when the $\mu_1-\mu_2 >0$ (like in our simulations), all other parameters being equal, an estimator is always less biased and variable when choosing a standardizer that is positively correlated with $\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}$. We also learn from Supplemental Material 3 that the smaller $n_c$, the larger the magnitude of correlation between $s_c$ and $\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}$. When $cor(S_c,\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2})$ is positive, the positive effect of increasing the magnitude of the correlation is counterbalanced by the negative effect of reducing $n_c$. On the other hand, when $cor(S_c,\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2})$ is negative, the negative effect of increasing the magnitude of the correlation is amplified by the negative effect of decreasing $n_c$. This explain why the difference between Glass's $g_s$ and other estimators is larger when Glass's $g_s$ is the least efficient estimator.}

In conclusion, Glass's \(g_s\) should always be avoided when the equality of variance assumption is met. Hedge's \(g_s\), Hedges' \(g'_s\) and Shieh's \(g_s\) are equally performant as long as the sample size ratio is close to 1. However, when designs are highly unbalanced, Shieh's \(g_s\) is not consistent anymore. While Hedge's \(g'_s\) is consistent, Hedges's \(g_s\) remains a better estimator.

Figures \ref{fig:idHetbal1} to \ref{fig:idHetunbal4} represent configurations where the equality of variances assumption is not met. According to our expectations, one observes that the bias of all estimators is approximately zero as long as the normality assumption is met (first column in the three Figures), and the further from the normality assumption (i.e.~when moving from left to right in Figures), the larger the bias\footnote{When looking at the relative bias for all estimators, the maximum departure from zero is 0.0173 when sample sizes are equal across groups, and 0.0274 when both sample sizes and variances differ across groups.}. It might be considered surprising that the bias of Hedges' \(g_s\) remains very small troughout these conditions. As discussed in the section \enquote{Different measures of effect size}, Hedges' \(g_s\) should be avoided when population variances and sample sizes are unequal across groups, because of the pooled error term. When pooling the estimates of two unequal population variances, the resulting estimator will be lower (in case of positive pairing) or larger (in case of negative pairing) as it should be. At the same time, when pooling two unequal population variances, the population effect size will also be lower (in case of positive pairing) or larger (in case of negative pairing) as it should be. As a consequence, the distorsion cannot be seen through the difference between the expected estimator and the population effect size measure. For this reason, the bias and variance of Hedges' \(g_s\) will not be taken into account in the following comparisons.

Figures \ref{fig:idHetbal1} and \ref{fig:idHetbal2} are dedicated to scenarios where population variances are unequal between groups and sample sizes are equal (condition c). In Figure \ref{fig:idHetbal1}, scenarios are subdivided as a function of the sample sizes and one can notice that all estimators are consistent, as their bias and variance decrease when the total sample size increases. In Figure \ref{fig:idHetbal2}, scenarios are subdivided as a function of the \(SD\)-ratio. Because the comparison pattern remains very similar for all sample sizes, we present only scenarios when sample sizes equal 20. One should first notice that for all estimators in Figure \ref{fig:idHetbal2}, the relative variance seems to be much larger when \(S_2>S_1\). This information should not be taken into account because it is only an artefact of our simulation conditions combined with the way we computed the relative variance. \footnote{We previously mentioned that when dividing the variance by $\delta^2$, we do not entirely remove the effect size effect. Actually, we introduce $\delta^2$ in the denominator of the first term, in the equation of the variance computation. Because we performed our simulations in order that $\sigma_1$ always equals 1, the smaller $S_2$, the larger the population effect size and therefore, the lower the relative variance.}
One observes that the bias and variance of both Shieh's \(g_s\) and Hedges' \(g'_s\) are identical, for any departures from the normality assumption, because sample sizes are equal across groups. The bias of Shieh's \(g_s\) (and then the bias of Hedges' \(g'_s\)) depends on the \(SD\)-ratio such that the larger the difference between \(\sigma_1\) and \(\sigma_2\), the larger the bias. On the other side, the bias of Glass's \(g_s\) does not depend on the \(SD\)-ratio. It is always a bit larger than the bias of Shieh's \(g_s\) (and Hedges' \(g'_s\)), but the difference decreases when \(SD\)-ratio get larger \(\left(i.e. \; \;\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = 10 \; or \; 0.1\right)\). While the bias of Glass's \(g_s\) does not depend on the \(SD\)-ratio, its variance decreases when the \(SD\)-ratio increases (i.e.~when \(S_C\) get larger, in comparison with \(S_e\)). This explains why the larger the \(SD\)-ratio, the larger the difference between the variance Glass's \(g_s\) using either \(S_1\) or \(S_2\) as standardizer. Regarding, Shieh's \(g_s\) and Hedges' \(g_s\), their variance get larger when the \(SD\)-ratio goes further from 1.

When samples are extracted from skewed distributions, the bias and variance of Glass's \(g_s\) are sometimes smaller and sometimes larger than the bias of Shieh's \(g_s\) and Hedges' \(g_s\). This is mainly due to the fact that when two samples of same sizes are extracted from two skewed distributions with unequal variances (i.e.~\(\sigma_1 \neq\sigma_2\), the two last columns in Figure \ref{fig:idHetbal2}), there will be non-null correlations of opposite sign between the mean difference (\(\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}\)) and the standardizer of \emph{all} estimators, depending on which population variance is the largest one \footnote{When population variances are unequal, a non-null correlation occurs between standardizers estimates and $\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}$. For standardizers computed based on both $S_1$ and $S_2$, the sign of the correlation between the standardizer and the means difference will be the same as the sign of the correlation between the mean difference and the estimate of the larger population variance. For interested readers, this is detailed in Supplemental Material 3.}.

Figures \ref{fig:idHetunbal1} to \ref{fig:idHetunbal4} are dedicated to scenarios where both samples sizes and population variances differ across groups. Due to a high number of combinations between the sample sizes-ratio and the variances-ratio in our simulations, we decided to present only some conditions. Because equations in Table 3 revealed an interaction effect between the sample sizes ratio and the \(SD\)-ratio on the bias and variance of Hedges' \(g_s\) and Shieh's \(g_s\) (see Supplemental Material 1), we chose to present all configurations where the larger \(SD\) is 10 times larger than the smaller \(SD\) (Figures \ref{fig:idHetunbal1} and \ref{fig:idHetunbal2}), and configurations where the larger \(SD\) is twice larger than the smaller \(SD\) (Figures \ref{fig:idHetunbal3} and \ref{fig:idHetunbal4}), in order to compare the effect of the sample sizes ratio on the bias and variance of all estimators when the \(SD\)-ratio is large (\(\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}=10 \; or \; .1\) ) or medium (\(\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}=2 \; or \; .5\)).

When distributions are symmetric, the bias of Glass's \(g_s\) only depends on the size of the control group and is therefore not impacted by neither the sample sizes ratio nor the total sample size. When comparing Figures \ref{fig:idHetunbal1} to \ref{fig:idHetunbal4}, one can also notice that the bias of Glass's \(g_s\) does not depend on the \(SD\)-ratio either. Unlike the bias of Glass's \(g'_s\), its variance depends on both sample sizes, but not in an equivalent way: most of the time, it is more efficient, in order to reduce the variance of Glass's \(g_s\), to add subjects in the control group. Regarding Hedges' \(g_s\) and Shieh's \(g'_s\), their respective biases and variances depend on an interaction effect between the sample sizes ratio and the \(SD\)-ratio \(\left( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \times \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \right)\): the sample sizes ratio associated with the smallest bias and variance is not the same when the more variable group is 10 times more variable than the other group (Figures \ref{fig:idHetunbal1} and \ref{fig:idHetunbal2}) than when it is only twice more variable (Figures \ref{fig:idHetunbal3} and \ref{fig:idHetunbal4}). However, the respective biases and variances of Hedges' \(g_s\) and Shieh's \(g_s\) are always smaller when there is a positive pairing between sample sizes and variances. When samples are extracted from skewed distributions, the bias and variance of Glass's \(g_s\) are sometimes smaller and sometimes larger than the bias of Shieh's \(g_s\) and Hedges' \(g_s\), due to a combination of three factors: (1) which group is the largest one, (2) which group has the smallest standard deviation and (3) what is the correlation between the standardizer and the means difference.

In summary, when variances are unequal across populations, Glass's \(g_s\) is sometimes better but also sometimes much worst than respectively Shieh's \(g_s\) and Hedges' \(g'_s\). The performance of Glass's \(g_s\) highly depends on parameters that we cannot control (i.e.~an triple interaction) and for this reason, we do not recommend using it. When designs are not \enquote{too unbalanced}, Shieh's \(g_s\) and Hedges' \$g'\_s" are both appropriate but the further the sample sizes ratio is from 1, the larger the bias of Shieh's \(g_s\) in order that in the end, our favourite measure is Hedges' \$g'\_s".

\paragraph{Method}\label{method-1}}

In order to compute confidence intervals around Cohen's \(g_s\), Glass's \(g_s\) (using respectively the sample \(SD\) of the first or second group as a standardizer), Hedges' \(g'_s\) and Shieh's \(g_s\), we created an R package (see \url{https://github.com/mdelacre/deffectsize}). In this package, confidence intervals were computed using non-central \emph{t}-distributions, as explained in Supplemental Material 4 \footnote{In Supplemental Material 4, we have also shown that in accordance with our expectations, the p-values associated with t-statistics always equal the percentage of confidence intervals based on the same statistical quantity that includes 0. This insures the reliability of our calculation method}.(SUPP MAT A RETRAVAILLER!). Based on this package, we performed Monte Carlo simulations to assess the \emph{coverage probability} of confidence intervals around all point estimators. As an indicator of accuracy, coverage probability is taken as the percentage of confidence intervals whose bounds correctly bracket the population value (\% of coverage). The coverage percentage of a confidence interval is expected to be the specified nominal level which is 95\% in our study.

Two-sided 95\% confidence intervals around point estimators were computed for a set of 504 scenarios (with 100,000 iterations per scenario). In 126 scenarios, samples were extracted from a normally distributed population and in 378 scenarios, samples were extracted from non normal population distributions. Refering to the review of Cain et al. (2017), all possible combinations of population skewness and kurtosis and the number of scenarios for each combination are summarized in Table 6.

For the 4 resulting combinations of skewness and kurtosis (see Table 6), scenarios varied as a function of the population mean difference (\(\mu_1-\mu_2\); 0 or 1), the sample sizes (\emph{\(n_1\)} and \emph{\(n_2\)}; 20, 50 or 100), the sample size ratio (\emph{n}-ratio = \(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\); .2, .4, .5, 1, 2, 2.5 or 5), the population \emph{SD}-ratio (i.e.~\(\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}\); .1, .25, .5, 1, 2, 4 or 10), and the sample size and population variance pairing \(\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\times\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}\right)\). All possible combinations of \emph{n}-ratio and population \emph{SD}-ratio were performed. In sum, the simulations grouped over different sample sizes yield 4 conditions (a, b, c and d) based on the \emph{n}-ratio, population \emph{SD}-ratio, and sample size and population variance pairing, as previously summarized in Table 5.
